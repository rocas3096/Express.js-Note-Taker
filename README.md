# Express.js-Note-Taker
        
## Description
This Express.js note taker was constructed to test my knowledge and skills in regards to server set up and implementation. More specifically I wanted to test my skills in using express. In using express I practiced creating post,fetch and get requests as well as their corresponding paths and responses. In addition to this I was also able to work on modifiying saved items by destructing user responses and then stringifying them for my db.json file. All in all it was a fun project that really let me dive into my new skillset and gave me a handy note maker for the future.
