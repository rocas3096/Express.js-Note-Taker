# Express.js-Note-Taker

## Description
This Express.js note taker was constructed to test my knowledge and skills regarding server setup and implementation. More specifically, I wanted to test my skills in using Express. In using Express, I practiced creating post, fetch, and get requests, as well as their corresponding paths and responses. Additionally, I was also able to work on modifying saved items by destructuring user responses and then stringifying them for my db.json file. All in all, it was a fun project that really let me dive into my new skill set and gave me a handy note maker for the future.

## Installation
To deploy this code on your own, head to the repository located here: [https://github.com/rocas3096/Express.js-Note-Taker](https://github.com/rocas3096/Express.js-Note-Taker). Once on the page, click the "Code" button and copy the repository using either HTTPS or SSH. Afterwards, open Git Bash and head to your chosen directory where you wish to clone this code. Once there, type `git clone` and then paste the link. The clone should copy to your local machine. Afterwards, type "npm install" to install the required nodes to run this code. Once they are installed, simply open your terminal and type `npm start` to use the server. When ready, the terminal will display text that says `App listening at http://localhost:${PORT} ðŸš€`. At that point, hold Ctrl and left-click on the link to open the project on your browser.

## Usage
Type `npm start` into your terminal to use the note taker. Once the link with the text displaying `App listening at http://localhost:${PORT} ðŸš€` appears, simply hold Ctrl and left-click to open the note taker in your browser. Click "Get Started," then begin typing your title and note content, and hit "Save" to save your note. If performed correctly, a note should be saved on the left-hand side and be viewable when the text is clicked. If you wish to delete it entirely, hit the small trash can icon on the right of your note. A demo has been provided below for your convenience.
