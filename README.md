# Express.js-Note-Taker

## Description
The Express.js Note Taker is a server-side application designed to showcase server setup and implementation skills, specifically focusing on using Express.js. It demonstrates the creation of routes for handling post, fetch, and get requests, along with their corresponding paths and responses. The application also includes functionality for modifying saved items by destructuring user responses and stringifying them for storage in a JSON file (db.json). This project provided an opportunity to dive into the Express.js skill set while building a useful note-taking application.
